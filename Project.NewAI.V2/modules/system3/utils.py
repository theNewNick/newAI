# utils.py
#
# This file serves as a placeholder for utility functions related to system3.
# Currently, all logic is contained in handlers.py or other modules as implemented.
#
# If you identify common helper functions in the future (e.g., for data validation,
# parsing, or scenario analysis calculations) that are used across multiple parts of
# system3, you can place them here.
#
# At this time, this file is intentionally left empty to maintain the agreed-upon structure
# and to keep the code fully updated without omissions.
