# scenario_analysis.py
#
# This module is intended for scenario-related utilities and functions.
# Currently, the logic for scenario analysis (adjustments based on sector, industry,
# sub-industry, scenario, feedback, sentiment, and historical data) is directly integrated
# within handlers.py to ensure the system works as currently structured.
#
# In the future, you may refactor and move scenario-related functions from handlers.py into
# this file for better modularity. For now, this file remains empty to adhere to the requested
# directory structure and maintain the fully updated code without omissions.
