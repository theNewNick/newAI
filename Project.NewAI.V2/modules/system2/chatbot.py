# chatbot.py
#
# This module is intended for chatbot-related utilities and functions.
# Currently, all chatbot logic (like get_response_from_openai) is integrated directly
# within handlers.py to ensure the system works as currently structured.
#
# In the future, you may refactor and move chatbot-related functions from handlers.py into
# this file for better modularity. For now, this file remains empty to adhere to the requested
# directory structure and maintain the fully updated code without omissions.
