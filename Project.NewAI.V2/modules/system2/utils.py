# utils.py
#
# This file serves as a placeholder for utility functions related to system2.
# Currently, all logic is contained in handlers.py or other modules (when they are fully implemented).
#
# If you identify common helper functions in the future (e.g., for text processing, embedding retrieval,
# or file handling) that are used across multiple parts of system2, you can place them here.
#
# At this time, this file is intentionally left empty to maintain the agreed-upon structure and
# to keep the code fully updated without omissions.
