# embedding.py
#
# This module is intended for embedding-related utilities and functions.
# Currently, all embedding logic (e.g., generate_embeddings, generate_query_embedding, etc.)
# is directly integrated in handlers.py to ensure the system works as provided.
#
# In the future, you may refactor and move embedding-related functions from handlers.py into
# this file for better modularity. For now, this file remains empty to adhere to the requested
# directory structure and maintain the fully updated code without omissions.
