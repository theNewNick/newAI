# utils.py
#
# This module serves as a placeholder for utility functions that may be reused across
# multiple files within system1. At this time, all logic is either contained in handlers.py
# or split into separate modules like financial_analysis.py and pdf_generation.py.
#
# If you identify common helper functions in the future (e.g., for date parsing, validation,
# or formatting), you can place them here.
#
# Currently, this file is intentionally left empty to adhere to the requested directory structure
# and to keep the code fully updated without omissions.
