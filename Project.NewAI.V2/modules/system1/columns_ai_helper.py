    It returns exactly one leftover column name from leftover_cols

    -----------
    needed_col : str
        The standard column name you still need (e.g. "Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)").
    leftover_cols : list of str
        The list of unmapped columns from your DataFrame after initial standardization.
    csv_name : str
        A short descriptor like "income_statement", "balance_sheet", etc.

    --------
    str
