"""
sentiment.py

Under the updated 'aggressive' approach, all necessary sentiment analysis is now
done directly in handlers.py (using call_openai_analyze_sentiment). We no longer
perform any multi-pass or raw-text sentiment here.

This file is intentionally minimal (or could be removed entirely) to avoid
duplicate summarization or multi-pass logic.

If you need to add shared sentiment-related utilities, you can place them here
in the future. For now, this file remains as a placeholder to maintain
the system1 directory structure.
