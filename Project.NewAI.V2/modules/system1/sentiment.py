# sentiment.py
#
# This module is intended for sentiment-related utilities and functions.
# Currently, all sentiment analysis logic is integrated directly within
# handlers.py and other modules as needed. This file is provided as a placeholder
# to maintain the modular structure outlined in the project plan.
#
# You may refactor and move sentiment-related functions from handlers.py into
# this file in the future, ensuring they remain separate and modular.

# At this time, no sentiment-related functions are duplicated here to avoid
# conflicts with handlers.py. This file is intentionally left empty.
